            // reference for the duration of this function call, but cannot guarantee uniqueness
            // after it returns. And indeed it might not be unique. Consider the following code and

            //     let mut iter = RatchetTreeIterMut::new(&mut tree, vec![0]);

            //  force first_mut_ref and another_first_mut_ref to alias.
            //
            //  Now our job is to make sure that you cannot access `iter.underlying_tree`, and also
            //  that the iterator itself does not return the same node multiple times. We do the
            //  former by making `underlying_tree` a private member and "being careful" in this
            //  module. We do the latter by deduping the vectors of indices upon initialization.
